#Tokens;
#it is the smallest individual unit in a python.
# they can be defined as a reserved word and each individual word in statement.
# the types of tokens are:
# identifiers
# operators
# literals
# keyword
# constant

# 1.An identifier is a variable name used to identify a variable.
# function name,classname,object name
#it can start with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore(_),and digits from 0 to 9.
#python is a case sensitive that means Name and name are two different identifiers in python.
#they can be combination of uppercase and lowercase letters,digits or an underscore(_).
#it can not start with digit.variable1 is valid and 1variable is not valid.
#we cannot use special symbols like @,%,$,# etc.
c = 10
#this is valid.
#multiple words can be separated by _.
emp_id = 5

#2.operators are special symbols in python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation.
#2 + 3 = 5
# + is an operator,2 and 3 are operands, 5 is the output of the operation.

#3.literals is used for representing a fixed value in the code
#name = "swetha" --- string literal
#age = 25 --- int is literal
#percentage =66.66 --- float is literal

#4.keywords are reserved words and has a specific meaning in a language and they cannot be used as an ordinary identifiers.
#false,and,as etc ..
#all the keywords are written in lowercase except the True and False.

#5.constant is a type of variable that cannot be changed are called constants.
#there are four types of constants in python;integer,float,string,boolean.
#constants are written in capital letters and separated by underscore for words.
#the number of days in a week represents a constant.
