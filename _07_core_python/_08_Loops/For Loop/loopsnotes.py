#python loops;
#In looping it simplifies the complex problems into the easy ones.
#instead of writing the same code again and again,we can repeat the same code
for a number of times.
#Advantages of loops:
#it will provide code re-usability.
#using loops there is no need of writing the same code again and again.
#using loops,we can traverse over the elements of data structures.

#Loop statements in python:For loop
                          # while loop
                        #do-while loop

 #For loop:it is used in the case where we need to execute some part of the code until the given condition is satisfied.
 #if we know already iteration number then use for loop.

x = "swetha"
for i in x:
    print(i)

'''

 #while loop:the while loop is to be used in the scenario if we dont know the number of iteration
#in advance,the block of statements is executed in while loop,it is called a pre-tested loop.


a = 0
while a<5:
    a = a+1
    print("swetha")
else:
    print("reddy")




#do-while loop:it continues until given condition satisfies
#it is used when it is necessary to execute the loop atleast once.
