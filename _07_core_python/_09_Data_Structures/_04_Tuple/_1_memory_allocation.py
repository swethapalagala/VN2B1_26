'''
A Tuple is a collection of Python objects separated by commas. (, , )
In someways a tuple is similar to a list in terms of indexing, nested objects and repetition 
but a tuple is immutable unlike lists which are mutable.
Difference Between List and Tuple in Python:  

SR.NO.	LIST	                                          TUPLE

1	Lists are mutable	                           1. Tuples are immutable
2	Implication of iterations is Time-consuming	   2.The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster
3	The list is better for performing operations,  3.Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements
    such as insertion and deletion.
4	Lists consume more memory	                   4.Tuple consume less memory as compared to the list
5	Lists have several built-in methods	           5.Tuple does not have many built-in methods.
6	The unexpected changes and errors are more     6.In tuple, it is hard to take place
    likely to occur
