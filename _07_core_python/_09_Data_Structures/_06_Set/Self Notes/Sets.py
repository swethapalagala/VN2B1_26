sets cannot have two items with the same value.
sets are written with curly brackets{}.
by using len() method we can know how many items are present in a set.
we can use set() constructor to make a set,by using double brackets.

set items:
unordered:it means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.
set items can appear in a different order every time when you use,and cannot be referred to by index or key.
unchangeable:it means we cannot change the items after the set has been created.
once a set is created,you cannot change its items,but you can remove items and add by add() method new items.

Data types in set items:string
