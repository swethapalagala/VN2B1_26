 1.what is OOPS?
 OOPs stands for representing the Object-Oriented Programming system.
Programs are treated as a collection of objects in oops. Each object is nothing but an example of a class.

2.Difference b/w procedural programming and oops?
      procedural programming                                 object-oriented programming

-it is based on functions.                                -It is based on real-world objects.
-It shows the data to the entire program.                 -It encapsulates the data.
-It does not have scope for code reuse.                   -It provides more scope of code reuse.
-It follows a the concept of top-down programming.        -It follows a bottom-up programming paradigm.
-Nature of the language is complicated.                   -It is less complicated in nature,
-It is hard to modify, extend and maintain the code.        so it is easier to modify, extend and maintain.

3. What are the basic concepts of OOPs?
The basic concepts of OOPs are:

Inheritance
Encapsulation
Polymorphism
Abstraction

4.What is an object?
Object: An object is an instance of a class and also It has its own identity and behaviour.

5.What is Method?
It basically goes for describing the set of instructions and it is also called a procedure.

6.What is a class?
Class is a kind of a user-defined data type that contains variables, properties, and methods.
It also helps to find the properties of an object.

7.What are the advantages of OOPS?
 OOPs is one of the main development approaches which is easily accepted,
 the advantages are many. Some of the advantages of OOPS include Re-usability, Data Redundancy, Code Maintenance, Security, Design Benefits,
Easy Troubleshooting, Better Productivity, Polymorphism Flexibility, and Problem-solving.
