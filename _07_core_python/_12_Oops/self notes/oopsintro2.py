#Inheritance:
#Inheritance is a concept in object oriented programming where existing classes,
can be modified by a new class.
#the existing class is called the base class and the new class is called the derived class.
#it is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class.
#we can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class.
#base class is also called parent class
#derived class is also called child class.
#It provides the re-usability of the code.


Polymorphism:
the word polymorphism means having many forms
Polymorphism in python defines methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class.
In inheritance, the child class inherits the methods from the parent class. Also, it is possible to modify a method,
in a child class that it has inherited from the parent class.


ENCAPSULATION:
Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP).
It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit.
Encapsulation is also an essential aspect of object-oriented programming.
It is used to restrict access to methods and variables.

combination of methods and attributes.


Data Abstraction:
Abstraction in Python is the process of hiding the real implementation of an application,
from the user and emphasizing only on usage of it.
Data abstraction is the reduction of a particular body of data to a simplified representation of the whole.
Abstraction, in general, is the process of taking away or removing characteristics from,
something in order to reduce it to a set of essential characteristics.

Data abstraction used:
Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information to the outside world and,
hiding their background details.
